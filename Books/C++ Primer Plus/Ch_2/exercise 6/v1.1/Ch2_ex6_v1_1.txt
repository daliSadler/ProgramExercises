----- Programming Exercise #6 -----
Instructions from page 63 (Prata, 2013).

"Write a program that has main () call a user-designed function that takes
a distance in light years as an argument and then returns the distance in
astronomical units. The program should request the light year value as
input from the user and display the result, as shown in the following code:

	Enter the number of light years: 4.2
	4.2 light years = 265608 astronomical units.

An astronomical unit is the average distance from the earth to the sun 
(about 150,000,000 km or 93,000,000 miles), and a light year is the 
distance light travels in a year (about 10 trillion kilometers or 6 trillion
miles). (The nearest star after the sun is about 4.2 light years away.) Use
type 'double' (as in Listing 2.4) and this conversion factor:
	
	1 light years = 63,240 astronomical units"
