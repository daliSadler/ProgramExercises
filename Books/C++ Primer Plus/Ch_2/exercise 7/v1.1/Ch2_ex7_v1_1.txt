----- Programming Exercise #7 -----
Instructions from page 63 (Prata, 2013). 

"Write a program that asks the user to enter an hour value and a minute
value. The main() function should then pass these two values to a type
'void' function that displays the two values in the format shown in the
following sample run:

	Enter the number of hours: 9
	Enter the number of minutes: 28
	Time: 9:28"

----- PLAN ------
- Create an "Empty" project on VS15 named "Ch2_ex7_v1.1"
- Create source file named "main.cpp"
- Add comments of project goals
- Use directive "#include <iostream>" to gain access to cout, cin and endl
- Use directive "using std::cin;", "using std::cout;" and "using std::endl;"
	to limit access of std class to only cout, cin and endl
- PROTOTYPE: Create a void function used to display the time input by user
	"void printTime(double HR, double MIN);"
- Create "int main(void)" function
-- Create two double type variables to saved data acquired from user
	"double userHR, userMIN;"
-- Acquire data from user
	"cout << "Enter the number of hours: ";"
	"cin >> userHR;"
	"cout << "Enter the number of minutes: ";"
	"cin >> userMIN;"
-- Call user-defined function and pass data acquired from user
	"printTime(userHR, userMIN);"
-- Keep output window open
	"cin.get();"
	"cin.get();"
-- close application
	"return 0;"
- PROTOTYPE DEFINITION:
	void printTime(double HR, double MIN)	
	{
		cout << "Time: " << HR << ":" << MIN << endl;
	}
