------ Programming Exercise #2 -----
Instructions from page 62 (Prata, 2013).

"Write a C++ program that asks for a distance in furlongs
and converts it to yards. (One furlong is 220 yards.)"

----- PLAN -----
- Create project on VS15, named "Ch2_ex2" in folder
	-- Books > C++ Primer Plus > Chapter 2 > exercise 2 > v1.1
- Create source file named "main.cpp"
- Use directive "#include <iostream>" for access to cin and cout
- use directive 'using std::cout;', 'using std::endl;' and 'using std::cin'
- Create function 'int main()'
- In function 'main()' create two 'double' variables 'furlong' and 'yards'
	to store data from user and calculation results.
- Ask user to input data
- Acquire data from user by using "cin >> " ask for furlong distance to 
	convert to yards, save data on 'furlong' variable.
- Using input saved to 'furlong' variable convert to yard by using formula
	-- yard = (furlong*220)
- Using "cout << " display results
- Call cin.get() twice to keep output window open
- Close program with "return 0;" statement
