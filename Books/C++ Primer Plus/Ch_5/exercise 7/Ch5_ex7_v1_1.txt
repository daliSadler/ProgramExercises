----- PROGRAM EXERCISE -----
"Design a structure called car that holds the following information about
an automobile: its make, as a string in a character array or in a string
object, and the year it was built, as an integer. Write a program that
asks the user how many cars to catalog. The program should then use new
to create a dynamic array of that many car structures. Next, it should
prompt the user to input the make (which might consist of more than one
word) and year information for each structure. Note that this requires
some care because it alternates reading strings with numeric data (see
Chapter 4). Finally, it should display the contents of each structure. A
sample run should look something like the following:

	How many cars do you which to catalog? 2
	Car #1:
	Please enter the make: Hudson Hornet
	Please enter the year made: 1952
	Car #2:
	Please enter the make: Kaiser
	Please enter the year made: 1951
	Here is your collection:
	1952 Hudson Hornet
	1951 Kaiser "
