Ch3_ex5
Version 1.1
Enith D. Sadler

----- Program Exercise -----
Instructions from page 112 (Prata, 2013).

"Write a program that requests the user to enter the current world population and
the current population of the U.S. (or of some other nation of your choice). Store
the information in variables of type long long. Have the program display the
percent that the U.S. (or other nation's) population is of the world's population.
The output should look something like this:

	Enter the world's population: 6898758899
	Enter the population of the US: 310783781
	The population of the US is 4.50492% of the world population. 

You can use the Internet to get more recent figures."

------ PLAN ------
- Create empty project on Visual Studio 2015 named "Ch3_ex5_v1.1"
- Create source file named "main.cpp"
- Add project details
- Include libraries required
	"#include <iostream>"
- limit use to libraries
	"using std::cin; using std::cout; using std::endl;"
- Create "int main(void)" function to run application
----- Create variables of type long long
	"long long world, US;
----- Ask for user input
----- Store user input for future use
----- Create a constant converter formula
	"const long long populationPercentage = (US/world)*100;
----- Output the results with cout
----- Maintain window open until next keystroke with 
	"cin.get(); cin.get();"
----- Close application with 
	"return 0;"

=================================================================================
----- FIXES TO MAKE -----
- Show correct percentage reminder (numbers after the decimal)
	- Maybe use math library
