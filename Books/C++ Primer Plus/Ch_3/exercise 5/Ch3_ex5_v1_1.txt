----- Program Exercise -----
Instructions from page 112 (Prata, 2013).

"Write a program that requests the user to enter the current world population and
the current population of the U.S. (or of some other nation of your choice). Store
the information in variables of type long long. Have the program display the
percent that the U.S. (or other nation's) population is of the world's population.
The output should look something like this:

	Enter the world's population: 6898758899
	Enter the population of the US: 310783781
	The population of the US is 4.50492% of the world population. 

You can use the Internet to get more recent figures."
