----- Program Exercise -----
Instructions from page 112 (Prata, 2013).

"Write a short program that asks for your height in feet and inches and your
weight in pounds. (Use three variables to store the information.) Have the
program report your body mass (BMI). To calculate the BMI, first convert your
height in feet and inches to your height in inches (1 foot = 12 inches). Then
convert your height in inches to your height in meters by multiplying by
0.0254. Then convert your weight in pounds into your mass in kilograms by
dividing by 2.2. Finally, compute your BMI by dividing your mass in kilograms
by the square of your height in meters. Use symbolic constants to represent
the various convertion factors."
