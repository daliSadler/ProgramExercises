Ch3_ex2
Version 1.1

----- Program Exercise -----
Instructions from page 112 (Prata, 2013).

"Write a short program that asks for your height in feet and inches and your
weight in pounds. (Use three variables to store the information.) Have the
program report your body mass (BMI). To calculate the BMI, first convert your
height in feet and inches to your height in inches (1 foot = 12 inches). Then
convert your height in inches to your height in meters by multiplying by
0.0254. Then convert your weight in pounds into your mass in kilograms by
dividing by 2.2. Finally, compute your BMI by dividing your mass in kilograms
by the square of your height in meters. Use symbolic constants to represent
the various convertion factors."

------ PLAN ------
- Create empty project on Visual Studio 2015 named "Ch3_ex2_v1.1"
- Create a source file named "main.cpp"
--- Add projects details
--- include iostream library
--- limit use of iostream to only cin, cout and endl
--- Create the int main function
------- Create variables to hold users data of type double (height feet and 
	inches, and weights)
------- Create const variables to create conversions
------- Ask user for their height in feet and inches, and their weight, save 
	data in the previously created variables
------- Convert feet data to inches by multiplying by twelve, save new data in 
	inches variable
------- Convert inches data to meters by multiplying by 0.0254
------- Convert weight data to kilograms by dividing by 2.2
------- Compute BMI by dividing your mass in kilograms by the square root of 
	your height in meters
------- Use cin.get() twice to keep output window open until next keystroke
------- Close application with command "return 0;"
