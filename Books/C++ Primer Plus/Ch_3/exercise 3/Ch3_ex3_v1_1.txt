Ch3_ex3
Version 1.1

----- Program Exercise -----
Instructions from page 112 (Prata, 2013).

"Write a program that asks the user to enter a latitude in degrees, minutes, and
seconds and that then displays the latitude in decimal format. There are 60
seconds of arc to a minute and 60 minutes of arc to a degree; represent these
values with symbolic constants. You should use a separate variable for each input
value. A sample run should look like this:

	Enter a latitude in degrees, minutes, and seconds:
	First, enter the degrees: 37
	Next, enter the minutes of arc: 51
	Finally, enter the seconds of arc: 19
	37 degrees, 51 minutes, 19 seconds = 37.8553 degrees "

------ PLAN ------
- Create an empty project on Visual Studio 2015 named "Ch3_ex3_v1.1"
- Create a source file named "main.cpp"
--- Add project details
--- include iostream library
--- limit use of iostream to only cin, cout and endl
--- Create "int main()" function
------ Create variables to hold user data of type double (degrees,
	 arcMin, arcSec)
------ Create const varible to create conversions
------ Ask user for the latitude, arc minute and arc degree
------ Convert data to decimal form by:
	- dividing from last data to first data input by 60
	  i.e. (((19/60) + 51)/60) +37

------ Output result to user
------ Maintain window open until users next keystroke (cin.get() twice)
------ Close application with "return 0;" command
