Ch3_ex1
Version 1.1
Enith D. Sadler

----- Programming Exercise #1 -----
Instructions from page 111 (Prata, 2013).

"Write a short program that asks for your height in integer inches and then
converts your height to feet and inches. Have the program use the underscore
character to indicate where to type the response. Also use a "const" symbolic 
constant to represent the conversion factor."

----- PLAN ------
- Create an empty project on VS15 named "Ch3_ex1_v1.1"
- Create a "main.cpp" file.
- Add details of the projects goal.
- Add "#include <iostream>" file to access cout, cin and endl
- Add command line "using std::cout;", "using std::cin;", and "using std::endl;"
	to limit access to only cout, cin and endl
- Create "int main()" function
	- create variables int inches and feet
	- ask user to input their height
	- use "cin.putback('_');" to display underscore prior to the heightIN
		variable
	- perform calculations
		- convert height in inches to feet by dividing inches by 12
		- save reminder of inches for future use
	- display conversion
	- keep window open until user's next keystroke with "cin.get()"
- close application with "return 0;" command

==============================================================================
----- FIXES TO MAKE -----
- If heightIN is '0' keep window open and ask for input from user again.
