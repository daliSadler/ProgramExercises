Ch2_ex4
Version 1.1
Enith D. Sadler

----- Programming Exercise #4 -----
Instructions from page 63 (Prata, 2013).

"Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her
age. The program then should display the age in months:

	Enter your age: 29

	Your age in months is 384."

----- PLAN -----
- Create a project on VS15 named "Ch2_ex4_v1.1"
- Create source file named "main.cpp"
- Add comments of the project goals
- Use directive "#include <iostream> to access cout, cin and endl
- Use directive "using std::cout;", "using std::cin", and "using std::endl;"
	to limit access to std commands
- Create "int main(void)" function
- Create two 'double' variables named 'years' and 'months'
- Ask user to input an age using "cout << "What is your age? ;"
	"cin >> years;" and save to 'years' variables
- Calculate years in month by multiplying by 12 and saving results in variable
	'months' (months = years*12)
- Return results using "cout << months << endl;"
- Keep output window open with "cin.get();" command being called twice
- Close application with "return 0;" command
