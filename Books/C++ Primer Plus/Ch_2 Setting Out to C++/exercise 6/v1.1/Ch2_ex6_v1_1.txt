----- Programming Exercise #6 -----
Instructions from page 63 (Prata, 2013).

"Write a program that has main() call a user-designed function that takes
a distance in light years as an argument and then returns the distance in
astronomical units. The program should request the light year value as
input from the user and display the result, as shown in the following code:

	Enter the number of light years: 4.2
	4.2 light years = 265608 astronomical units.

An astronomical unit is the average distance from the earth to the sun 
(about 150,000,000 km or 93,000,000 miles), and a light year is the 
distance light travels in a year (about 10 trillion kilometers or 6 trillion
miles). (The nearest star after the sun is about 4.2 light years away.) Use
type 'double' (as in Listing 2.4) and this conversion factor:
	
	1 light years = 63,240 astronomical units"

----- PLAN -----
- Create an "Empty" Project on VS15 named "Ch2_ex6_v1.1"
- Create a source file named "main.cpp"
-- Add comments of the projects goals
-- Use directive "#include <iostream>" to gain access to cout, cin and endl
-- Use directive "using std::cout;", "using std::cin;" and "using std::end"
	to limit access of class std to only cout, cin and endl
-- PROTOTYPE: Create a user-defined function to convert light years into astronomical
	units of data type 'double' that passes a 'double' type variable
	"double LYconvAU(double a);"
-- Create "int main(void)" function
--- Create two 'double' type variables named LY (for light years) and AU
	(for astronomical units)
--- Ask user to input a numeric number to convert from LY to AU
	"cout << "Enter the number of light years: ";"
	"cin >> LY;"
--- Call user-defined conversion 
	"AU = LYconvAU(LY);"
--- Print results 
	"cout << LY << " light years = " << AU << " astronomical units" 
	<< endl;"
--- Keep output window open for user to view results
	"cin.get();"
	"cin.get();"
--- Close the application
	"return 0;"
-- PROTOTYPE DEFINITION
--- Create the "double LYconvAU(double a)" definition
	{	
		return (a * 63240);
	}
