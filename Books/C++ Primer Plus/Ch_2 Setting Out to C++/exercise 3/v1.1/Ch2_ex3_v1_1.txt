Ch2_ex3
Version 1.1

----- Programming Exercise #3 -----
Instructions from page 63 (Prata, 2013).

"Write a C++ prgoram that uses three user-defined functions
(counting main() as one) and produces the following output:

	Three blind mice
	Three blind mice
	See how they run
	See how they run

One function, called two times, should produce the first two
lines, and the remaining function, also called twice, should
produce the remaining output."

----- PLAN -----
- Create a project on VS15 named "Ch2_ex3_v1.1"
- Create source file named "main.cpp"
- Add comments of the project goal
- Use directive "#include <iostream>" to access cout, cin and endl
- Use directive "using std::cout;", "using std::cin" and 
	"using std::endl" to limit access to std commands
- Create two defined function named "void blindMice(void);" and 
	"void howTheyRun(void);"
- Create "int main(void)" function
-- call the user-defined functions, twice each
--- "blindMice()" * 2
--- "howTheyRun()" * 2
-- call cin.get() twice to keep output open until user input
- exit application with "return 0;" command.
- Define the user-defined functions created above main()
