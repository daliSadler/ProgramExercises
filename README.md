Coding from books

I will complete exercises from books and improve them to show different ways to get the same results.

Repository aiming to provide code examples for future employers to review.

Added folders to help organize the work. Created a folder named 'Books' and another one named 'C++ Primer Plus', once there the work is divided into chapters and then exercises and their own versions. Each exercise folder has a text file with information on the exercises, location of where I have found it and a step-by-step plan to creating the assignment.
